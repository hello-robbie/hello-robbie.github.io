They publish daily handler diaries, offer practical incident response tools, and provide a platform where people like you and me can contribute valuable data. One of the most impactful ways to do that is by running a DShield Honeypot . DShield is a low-interaction honeypot that collects SSH, Telnet, and HTTP scan data. It\u2019s lightweight, informative, and most importantly, it shares that telemetry with ISC to help map emerging threats. Setting one up on AWS is a great weekend project, especially if you're into networking, cloud, or cybersecurity. Below is a step-by-step guide I followed and adapted from Matthew OB's post . Comprehensive Guide: Setting Up a DShield Honeypot on AWS (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) What is DShield? DShield is a honeypot system built by ISC to collect logs from distributed sensors. It: Captures SSH/Telnet login attempts (via Cowrie) Records HTTP requests and firewall activity Sends anonymized logs to ISC Requirements AWS Free Tier account DShield account: https://secure.dshield.org/myaccount.html SSH key pair Basic Linux/terminal experience Tips: Enable MFA on AWS Use IAM users instead of root Set Free Tier alerts to avoid surprises Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance Go to EC2 \u2192 Launch Instance Name: DShieldHoneypot AMI: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (not 24.04!) Type: t2.micro Key pair: Use or create .pem file Storage: 25 GB Security Group: Allow SSH (port 22) from YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/32 Step 2: Connect & Update chmod 400 your-key.pem ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y sudo reboot Reconnect after reboot. Step 3: Create Honeypot User & Harden Sudo sudo passwd ubuntu sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos \"DShield Honeypot\" dshield sudo visudo /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users Change this line: ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL To: ubuntu ALL=(ALL) ALL Step 4: Install Dependencies sudo apt install python3-pip python2.7 git -y curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py sudo python2.7 get-pip.py sudo reboot Step 5: Install DShield mkdir ~/install && cd ~/install git clone https://github.com/DShield-ISC/dshield.git cd dshield/bin sudo ./install.sh During setup: Accept privacy warnings Enable automatic updates Enter your DShield email + API key Interface: eth0 Admin Port: 12222 (default) Local Network: 172.16.0.0/12 Ignore FW logs from your public IP Accept default SSL values Exclude ports: 2222, 2223, 8000 Step 6: Confirm SSH on Port 12222 sudo ss -tuln | grep 12222 sudo systemctl restart ssh # if not open sudo ss -tuln | grep 12222 Update your security group to allow TCP 12222 from your IP, then test: ssh -p 12222 -i your-key.pem ubuntu@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP> Once confirmed: sudo reboot Step 7: Configure Security Group Inbound Rules: Port Range Protocol Source Purpose 12222 TCP YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/32 SSH Management 0-12221 TCP/UDP 0.0.0.0/0 Honeypot Listeners 12223-65535 TCP/UDP 0.0.0.0/0 Honeypot Listeners All ICMP ICMP 0.0.0.0/0 Ping/Traceroute Outbound Rules: Port Protocol Destination Purpose All All 0.0.0.0/0 Allow all traffic Make sure the Security Group is associated with the instance, and apply NACLs if needed. Step 8: Verify Operation cd ~/install/dshield/bin ./status.sh You should see: Submitted to DShield: N log(s) sent. All services running. Step 9: Monthly Maintenance sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y sudo reboot cd ~/install/dshield/bin ./update.sh Step 10: View Logs on DShield Visit: https://secure.dshield.org/myaccount.html You\u2019ll find: - SSH Logs - Web Logs - Firewall Events You're Done! Your honeypot is now online and feeding data into ISC\u2019s global threat map. You've helped contribute to public good in the infosec community and learned a lot in the process. \ud83d\udc4f Check out Matthew OB\u2019s original guide for visuals or troubleshooting.","title":"Why I Use Honeypots"},{"location":"blog/honeypots/#why-i-like-internet-storm-center-dshield-and-how-you-can-help-too","text":"I'm a big fan of the SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC) and its community-driven mission to track global internet threats.
